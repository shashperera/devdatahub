### GitHub releases
GitHub releases provide a structured way to package and deliver software updates or project milestones.  A release in GitHub is a snapshot of a project at a specific point in time, typically associated with a version or a significant milestone.
- They offer versioning, changelogs, and distribution of assets. 
- Key features include automation with GitHub Actions, draft releases for preparation, pre-releases for early testing, and dedicated release pages for organized information. 
- Releases enhance transparency, aid communication, and are commonly used in open-source projects.
